# Unofficial Iliad Backend (Web Scraping)

This project was created as a **learning exercise** when Iliad did not yet offer an official mobile app.  
The idea was to build an **unofficial backend** that could interact with the Iliad customer area via **web scraping**, and then develop a companion app on top of it.

## Purpose

- Explore how to simulate login and data fetching from Iliad's website
- Build an API layer over the scraped data
- Train backend and frontend development skills by creating a full stack (unofficial) version of an Iliad app

## Technologies

- **Spring boot**

## Usage

> This project requires valid Iliad credentials to work.
